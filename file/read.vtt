This is the home webpage and its file name is index.html.

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.980
This part is the first section of the website and serves as the main entry point.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.599
It uses multimedia elements to make the page more interactive.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.140
It also contains different HTML elements to demonstrate multimedia integration.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.359

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.399
Next, the audio is included to explain the content of the webpage.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.960
It contains an explanation and serves as proof of my capability to import elements.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.519
The button is connected to links for navigation.

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:34.820
Lastly, the video is about my previous project.

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.380
I also used CSS to customize the elements, such as the layout.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.520
I used the flex function for proper positioning and applied a background color.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.520
The webpage uses different CSS functions to enhance its design and overall appearance.
